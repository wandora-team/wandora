aggregate and combine information from various different sources. You can manipulate the 
collected knowledge flexible and efficiently, and without programming skills. More 
generally speaking Wandora is a general purpose information extraction, management 
and publishing application based on [Topic Maps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_Maps) 
and [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29). Wandora suits well for

## Developer Introduction

Wandora was originally developed with the [Netbeans IDE](https://netbeans.apache.org/).
Since October 2018 we have started developing Wandora with Eclipse, preferably 
Eclipse IDE for Java Developers version 4.27.0. Eclipse development has changed
the library retrieval and build process. Wandora uses Gradle for dependency management and building application packages.

To compile and run Wandora, a Java JDK 17 or later is required.

Developers interested in Wandora project should note that our long term plans
include using Eclipse as a primary development tool.
