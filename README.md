## Developer Introduction

To compile and run Wandora, a Java JDK 17 or later is required.

Wandora uses Gradle for dependency management and building application packages.

We use Eclipse, preferably Eclipse IDE for Java Developers version 4.27.0.

Wandora was originally developed early 2000. Wandora is now going through a process where we try to modernize many of the underlying technologies and throw away deprecated features. There is no schedule for the next Wandora release yet.

If you wish to look at the old version of Wandora checkout git tag 'master-old'.
