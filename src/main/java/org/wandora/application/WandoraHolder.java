 * This class is a wrapper for Wandora. Purpose of it is to be able to
 * pass a reference to Wandora before it is actually constructed. This can
 * be achieved by creating a new instance of WandoraAdminHolder without Wandora.
 * Then later setting Wandora in the holder. This was needed when wandora
 * and most of its tools were initialized and/or implemented with bean shell
 * scripting language. Currently this class has little use.
