/**
 * An exception that is thrown when the user cancels an operation. This is
 * usually thrown by TopicPanel.applyChanges. That method will apply any
 * changes made in the topic panel. These changes may result in topics being
 * merged or split which will cause a warning dialog to be shown. The user
 * can cancel the operation with this dialog which will cause the changes done
 * in the panel to not be applied and this exception be thrown. In such a case
 * the operation that called applyChanges should be canceled. You should also
 * always call applyChanges right at the start of your tool or operation so that
 * you can cancel early and not need to revert back any changes after user
 * aborts the operation.
