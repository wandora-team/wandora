/**
 * Used to tag classes that are specifically designed to work well with XMLParamProcessor.
 *
 * Must have a constructor with no parameters. After constructor returns, the init method is called.
 * You should perform most of the initialization here, as it will be provided with the xml element (and its children)
 * from the xml file. You can use processor to parse the parameters inside the element (using XMLParamProcessor.crateArray
 * for example) or do whatever custom initialization that is necessary. The created object will be added to
 * the processor symbol table by the processor where necessary after the initialization returns.
 *
 * Note that the required constructor cannot be enforced in Java with interfaces so there will be no compile
 * time errors if you fail to provide it but implement this interface. This will however result in a run time
 * error when XMLParamProcessor tries to instantiate your class.
