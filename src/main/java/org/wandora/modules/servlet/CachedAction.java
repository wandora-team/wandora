/**
 * <p>
 * This is a base class for actions that take advantage of caching
 * services. You can naturally also directly use the caching service without
 * deriving from this class, but many common operations are already done here.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As described in the CacheService class, the basic idea in caching is that
 * each cached page has a unique key identifying it. If in the future you
 * need a page with a key that has already been cached, you can just return
 * the cached page instead. The key itself is just any string that identifies the
 * page. As such, everything that affects the page has to be somehow included
 * in the key. This class contains a method, buildCacheKey, that takes a String
 * map and builds a cache key based on that. The key will essentially be a
 * serialisation of the Map. It is not required that you use this method
 * to make the key but it is suitable for most situations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Obviously it is not useful to cache actions that are highly dynamic
 * and requests with the exact same key are unlikely to happen often.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To have an action use caching at all, the caching parameter in init parameters
 * has to be set to true. By default caching is turned off. This is because many
 * actions derive from this class that could potentially benefit from caching
 * in some situations but not always. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When extending this class, you have to override at least the doOutput method,
 * which writes the page into a stream. The stream might either be returned
 * directly, or it may be written to a disk from where a copy is then automatically
 * returned to the request.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can also override returnOutput, which forwards
 * data from an input stream into an HTTP response. The input stream might be
 * coming from a cached file, or directly from do Output. The default implementation
 * sets the HTTP headers possibly defined in AbstractAction and then copies the
 * output directly. If you wish to set additional headers, such as content type
 * or character encoding, the way to do it is to use writeMetadata in doOutput,
 * which writes some extra information at the start of the stream, and then
 * readMetadata at returnOutput, which reads it. Then you can add headers, or
 * do anything else necessary, based on the metadata. The writing and reading
 * of metadata must always be done symmetrically.
 * </p>
