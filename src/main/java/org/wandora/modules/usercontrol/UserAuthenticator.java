/**
 * <p>
 * The base interface for authenticators. Authenticators authenticate a
 * user based on the received HTTP request. They may also hijack the request and
 * even reply to it, for example to send back a login form. By completing the
 * login form, the user will send the required login details to the authenticator
 * and then it lets the user access other features.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The result of the authentication is returned as an AuthenticationResult object.
 * This has three fields. The authenticated indicates tells whether authentication
 * succeeded. The responded field indicates whether a response was sent in case
 * the authentication didn't succeed. The response could be an error message or
 * a login form or something similar. Finally the user field contains the
 * authenticated user. The user field may be set even if authentication fails.
 * This would be the case if the user provided a correct user name and password
 * but the user doesn't have the required privileges. Also, the user is not
 * necessarily set even if authentication succeeds. This would be the case if
 * anonymous was allowed.
