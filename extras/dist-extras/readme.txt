Start using Wandora
===================

Wandora is a Java Swing application. Wandora requires Java JDK 8 or later.
Java JDK is not part of Wandora but you need to download and install it
separately. We suggest you use Oracle's Java as it includes the JavaFX by
default.

After you have installed Java JDK, you can start Wandora application
with one of the startup scripts located in the bin directory.

If your operating system is Linux/Unix/MacOs, start the application
with Wandora.sh. Check script's execution permissions before running the file.
If your operating system is Windows, start the application with Wandora.bat.

You should see Wandora's splash window shortly after starting the startup
script and the application window little later, if everything went well. Look
at the output in the shell window if the application window doesn't show up.
